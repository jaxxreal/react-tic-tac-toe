# tic-tac-toe game with React:

### Motivation
I choose React.js for the following reasons:

1. One of the most easy going frameworks that could be used to build/startup a project.
2. Can simply add more features (and optimise them) at any giving time.
3. Could easily separate game logic and UI rendering code (as requested).
4. I wanted to play with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
5. I’m familiar with it.

### If it was my main project, what would be my next steps?

I would’ve done it differently, I would’ve added:

1. Simple main menu. 
2. Better UI (keeping in mind that less is more). 
3. Difficulty level (Novice, Mid, Master). 
4. Tutorial. 
5. Undo option (for Novice level only). 
6. Player vs player option. 
7. Save current game state. i.e: if the user close the tab, s/he could always reopen it & go back to where s/he left the game. 
8. Score (personal high-score/leaderboard). 
9. Additional game type (4x4 - 6x6 - 8x8 …) 
10. Include additional instruments to gather data/analytics on how the users play this game.
